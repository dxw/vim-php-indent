# vim-php-indent

I've tried several PHP indenting plugins, none of them seemed to care about that case where you have PHP and HTML in the same file so I made my own.

## Installation

Use [unbundle.vim](https://github.com/sunaku/vim-unbundle) or [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and do the following:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/dxw/vim-php-indent.git

## Testing

Requires [vroom](https://github.com/google/vroom):

    vroom test/*.vroom

## Licence

MIT - see COPYING.md
